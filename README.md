Overview of Project: 

In this module, you will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.


On this project, I am helping Dana. Her goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. To accopmlish this displaying data with an HTML page and a dynamic table to present has been the focus.

Results:

When a user visits the html page, by default the table will be displaying all available data. 

By using "Filter Search" user input section, the user can filter the data by day, city, state, country, and shape to narrow it down based on the interest.

Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
